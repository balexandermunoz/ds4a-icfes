        'Laura': `My name is Laura Vanessa Rocha Laguna, I am 28 years old and I am a professional in international business and marketing from Santo Tomas University. In 2019 I did a master's degree in project management with OBS Business School and the University of Barcelona. I currently work at Teleperformance in my role as a reporting analyst. I am in charge of creating reports in Power BI aimed at the operation so that they have visibility of the behavior of the KPIs. I am passionate about data and I like to constantly enrich myself with new knowledge that helps me grow professionally. In my free time I like to have a nice time with my family, friends and my two dogs, Kira and Homer`,
        'Brayan': `I'm a physicist with special interest in Computer science, Quantum Mechanics, Optics and programming. 
                    I have a lot of projects in Javascript with CSS, HTML with React and Vue 3.0 but Python is my prefer programming language. I also code in C++. I'm highly skilled in mathematical modelling, data analysis, algorithm development and machine learning. In fact, I've completed two specializations, the first one on Machine Learning and the other one on Natural Language Processing. 
                    In my spare time I do small and medium-sized webpages and programming projects. I also enjoy read, make some art and play video games. 
                    I'm looking for some challenges and problems to solve in different areas of science, technology and interdisciplinary projects. That makes me happy.`,
